  {{Angular Route guards can be used to control whether the user can navigate to
  or away from the given route based on some condition. Angular provide the
  route cards for the same purpose one of the common scenarios where we can
  use a route card is authentication, So we want our app to stop the
  unauthorized users fromaccessing the protected routes When a user clicks on
  the buy course button of the course in that case the user should be
  redirected to the check-in page only the user is logged in if the user is
  not logged in that case he should not be redirected to the check-in page in
  that case he should be redirected to login page first so that he will first
  login and then he can buy the coursefor such scenarios we can use angular's
  route cards. Use cases To confirm the navigation operation Asking whether to
  save data before moving away from view Allow access to certain parts of the
  application to specific users Validating the route parameters before
  navigating to the route Fetching some data before you display the component
  view In Angular }}

  {{ we have 5 different types of route cardsand these are canActivate, canDeactivate,Resolve,CanLoad,CanActivateChild
  }}
  {{How to create a route Guard }}
  {{1.Create a route guard as a service @Injectable() export calss CourseRouteService{} }}
  {{2.implements canActive interface 
  export calss CourseRouteService implements canActive{} }}

  {{3.Implement the required route guard method. 
    export calss CourseRouteService implements canActive{
    canActivate() { //check wether the route can be activated //From this method
    we need to return a boolean value either true or false if we return true
    from this method in this case the navigation process will continue but if we
    return false from here in that case the navigation process will stop and the
    user will not to be redirected to the route return true; // return false if
    you want to cancel the navigation } 4. provide the Guard service from the
    root appmodule  }}
